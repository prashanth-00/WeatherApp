Hi to those who are viewing this project, I have used open wheather Api for weather data for real time weather data.
this application provides real time weather information by taking city name from the user.
if you want to set up this project in your local system you can go to open weather api and get 
the Api key by signing up to their website or you can simply use My Api key which i have used in this 
project.

for Server setup, i have used Tomcat 10.0 for this project.
